 move legalization (check)

 per piece evaluation
 
 move generation

 position evaluation:
  check for checkmate and stalemate




if imo:
 ; p: attack even if empty or own

 ; k/q/r/b: also attack own pieces, 
 ;     store first attacked piece

 ; n: also attack own pieces
 ;    store first attacked piece 

legality check:
 if not in check: {
 if king move:
  is destination field attacked?
  (by checking torow & tocol)
 if other move:
  do move on copy of board,
  for every piece that has
  stored it as "attacked piece":
   check if it now attacks the 
   king
 }

 ; if in check
 ;  (if king field attacked): {
 ; king move:
 ;  destination field attacked?
 ; other move:
 ;  do move on copy of board,
 ;  for every piece that has

eval:
    make checkmate worth              a lot
    make stalemate worth              0

move(::move):
    ; auto detect en passant ability
    ; auto remove castling ability
    ; auto remove en passant ability

    ; normal move
    ; castling
    ; en passant
    ; promotion

think of all possible moves:
    if in check, the only possible moves may be moving the king, or fixing the check

    check if move is actually legal:
        check for if any (illegal) moves by the opponent are attacking the king if you would move your move    

fenloader: properly set worth

for every possible move:
    think of all other possible moves
    for every possible move:
        think of all other possible moves
        for every possible move:
            .......

think of what's the worst that can happen, give a worse-ness score to all of them

pick the move with the lowest worse-ness score

FIX move(string &move)

think of all possible moves:
    if in check, the only possible moves may be moving the king


    castling
    en-passant
    promotion
    pawn either move forward or *capture* sideways

    pawn:
        ; 1 forward
        ; 2 forward (when on starting row)

        ; sideways:
        ;     just normally: left, right
        ; en-passant
        promotion (both forward and sideways)
    
    rook: (not allowed to go through stuff...)
        left
        right
        down
        up
    
    knight: (allowed to go through stuff)
        2 left 1 up
        2 left 1 down

        2 right 1 up
        2 right 1 down

        2 up 1 left
        2 up 1 right

        2 down 1 left
        2 down 1 right

    bishop: (not allowed to go through stuff...)
        sideways left up
        sideways left down

    queen: (not allowed to go through stuff...)
        sideways left up
        sideways left down
        sideways right up
        sideways right down

        left
        right
        down
        up

    king: (not allowed to go through stuff...)
        sideways left up
        sideways left down
        sideways right up
        sideways right down

fenloader: properly set worth

set-depth 4 (for now)

for every possible move:
    think of all other possible moves
    for every possible move:
        think of all other possible moves
        for every possible move:
            .......

think of what's the worst that can happen, give a worse-ness score to all of them

pick the move with the lowest worse-ness score

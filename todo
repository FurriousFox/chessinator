just start

read moves
write moves

make sort of map in memory
think of all possible moves:
    castling
    en-passant
    promotion
    pawn either move forward or *capture* sideways

fenloader: properly set worth

set-depth 4 (for now)

for every possible move:
    think of all other possible moves
    for every possible move:
        think of all other possible moves
        for every possible move:
            .......

think of what's the worst that can happen, give a worse-ness score to all of them

pick the move with the lowest worse-ness score
